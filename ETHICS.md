## 🌍 Mission

QashqAI Voice is a multilingual, non-commercial AI initiative that empowers marginalized speakers, especially those using endangered languages like Qashqai Turkic, Middle Persian, and others. The project supports:

- Cultural and linguistic preservation  
- Inclusion of stateless, disabled, and rural communities  
- Ethical, decolonial use of AI technology  

---

## ✅ Ethical Commitments

- No part of this project may be reused without attribution.  
- We welcome collaboration — but not replication without dialogue.  
- Cultural sovereignty and community consent must guide all AI tools developed for or inspired by this initiative.  
- Voice-based data is sensitive: we strongly discourage unsupervised use of voice cloning for any endangered communities.
